# progress-clock
A clock which uses progress bars to visualise time at varying scales.

I'm terrible at visualising time. This clock helps me know where I am in the current hour, day, month, year. 

## TODO
- Wrap into a mobile app, probably using Cordova
- Add user-configurable timescales (birthdays, say, or project deadlines)
